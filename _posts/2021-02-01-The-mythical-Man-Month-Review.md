**Book:** Mythical Man-Month by Frederick Brooks Jr.

The book contains a lot of exciting information about a project organization for
a tech guy. How a team should be organized to make a consistent system? What
dangerous situation an architecture can meet (the second system)? Which and how
docs can help to create a product? The author touches on a lot of important
questions in the whole process of software development.

Also, the end of the book contains a list of the main points of each chapter +
an overview over 20 years after the first edition of the book.

There are a lot of references for performance measurements and statistics
(almost all of them were done in the past with old technologies, but the
comparison is still useful). But unfortunately, some of them are unavailable
now. For example, I was interested in the proof for one thesis. The author
referenced Lehman and Belady's "Programming system dynamics", given at the ACM
SIGOPS, October 1971, but unfortunately, this article is unavailable on the
Internet.
