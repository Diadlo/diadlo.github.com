**Book:** The Deadline: A Novel about Project Management by Tom DeMarco

I can't decide the quality of the book from the management side since I have no
management experience but it's a book that's easy to read and contains some
interesting information about building a big tech product in an artistic manner.
Book characters come to decisions based on some in-book researchers. I'm not
sure if such researches were done in reality, but if so their results look
exciting. Here I talk about researches about developer productivity under press
or under overtime.

Because it's quite small and easy to read I think you should consider reading
the book.
