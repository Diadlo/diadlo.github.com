# Impress doesn't impress at all

I recently needed to make a presentation. It should be pretty simple. I opened
LibreOffice Impress and was disappointed. I didn't work with the Impress for a
long time. It was never any good. But I don't remember if it was soo bad before.
Default UI is two bars with a lot of different sorts of buttons.

## The top (aka Standart) bar

The first bar contains hot actions:

* file actions
* edit action (why does CLONE FORMATTING is there :sob:?)
* view settings
* insert
* slide show
* slides management (new, duplicate, delete slide)
* Show Draw Function button

They are all placed in one line without a single separator!

Later I discovered that "slides management" is actually a separate toolbar. But
you can hardly guess this unless you try to turn the different toolbars on and
off.

## The Drawing toolbar

It's a bar with drawing tools. Nothing special. But it's the only toolbar, that
you can open from the Standart bar using the "Show Draw Function" button.

Probably the most needed one. Or is it? :thinking:

Why do I ask it? I couldn't find a toolbar to customize text formatting.
After quick googling I [found][ask_formatting], that there is NO SUCH TOOLBAR!

## Quick bugs

I spend some time trying to find a formatting toolbar. But instead, I found that
unlocking the toolbar can lead to such things.

Nothing special. There are plenty of bugs in my code. It was just another hit to
me.
