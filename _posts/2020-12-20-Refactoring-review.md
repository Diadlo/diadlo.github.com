![The book cover](https://martinfowler.com/books/refact2.jpg)

**Book:** Refactoring by Martin Fowler, with Kent Beck

The book is bloated. The author can spend a few pages writing about a variable
renaming. The most useful part is the first four chapters. Talking about
refactoring in common, best practices to do it, and tests.

The rest of the book can be overviewed without great attention. Only the
"Motivation" section can be useful in all these sections.
